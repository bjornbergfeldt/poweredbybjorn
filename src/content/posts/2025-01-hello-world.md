Low-code has been a game-changer for building solutions quickly and efficiently. But the way we think about low-code is changing. The future is leaning heavily into **natural language, generative AI, and code generation**, allowing us to describe what we want and letting the system do the heavy lifting.

Is Power Platform obsolete because of this? **Absolutely not.** If anything, it’s positioned better than most platforms to ride this wave. Low-code isn’t disappearing. It’s **evolving**, moving toward an **AI and agent-driven platform**, where solutions become smarter, more autonomous, and more intuitive to build.

I’ve been diving deep into generative AI in the Power Platform and Microsoft space lately, exploring how generative AI can accelerate app building, automations, and agentic solutions. And honestly, this feels just like the beginning. There’s **so much more to come**, and the possibilities for transforming work are huge.

If you’re curious about the intersection of **low-code, AI, and the next generation of solutions**, this is a space to watch closely and experiment boldly.
